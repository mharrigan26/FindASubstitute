# FindASubstitute
CS304 final project - Find A Substitute

This project displays a semester's worth of database and web design instruction. It was born out of the frustration all three group members have experienced
when trying to find substitutes for shift-based jobs. Often we would have to contact other workers asking for coverage without knowing if they were available
or not. This app allows users to create a profile, enter their work schedule, shift preferences, and time availability. This will allow users to make 
substitution requests and see a list of people who are available for that shift, informing them whom to contact without wasting time on those who will decline.

Please note that this class was taken during the spring semester of 2020, meaning it was interrupted by the Covid pandemic and we had
to adjust to remote classes in the middle of this project.
